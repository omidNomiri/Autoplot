## Auto Ploter

This is a R program for everyone who want extract plots and in the world of statics we have a lots of plot. Its boring if you get and setup one by one to show what it is and how is look for your data, so you run **Auto plot** program and see the result. After the seeing your result on your dataset. choose what you like and go for stup.

### Example

we say your dataset is **iris** dataset and we run auto ploter on it.

by defult you summry your data and thing what plot good for your data

```{r iris}
summary(iris)
```
you can see some data in here

```{r show data, echo = FALSE}
numericInput("n", 
 "How many data?", 5)
renderTable({
 head(iris, input$n)
})
```

or setup plots one by one like this

```{r show plot, echo=TRUE}
data(iris)

counts <- table(iris$Species)

counts <- counts[is.finite(counts)]

pie(counts,
    main = "Distribution of Iris Species",
    col = c("red", "blue", "green"))
```

but with this program you just say

```{r use case of auto_plot, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
auto_plot(iris)
```

and here your result
